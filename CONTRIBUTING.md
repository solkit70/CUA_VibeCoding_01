# Contributing to OpenAI Realtime Console

We love your input! We want to make contributing to OpenAI Realtime Console as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process
We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Branch Naming Convention
Please name your branches following this convention:
- `feature/` - for new features
- `bugfix/` - for bug fixes
- `docs/` - for documentation changes
- `test/` - for test additions or modifications

Example: `feature/add-voice-recognition`

## Commit Message Convention
We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

- `feat:` - a new feature
- `fix:` - a bug fix
- `docs:` - documentation only changes
- `style:` - changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- `refactor:` - code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `test:` - adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore:` - changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

Example: `feat: add voice activity detection threshold control`

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, if applicable.
2. Update the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version.
3. The PR may be merged once you have the sign-off of at least one other developer.

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using GitHub's [issue tracker](https://github.com/yourusername/openai-realtime-console/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue]().

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
